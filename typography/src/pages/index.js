		<h2>The fox, quick and brown</h2>
		<p>
			<em>Foxes</em> are small-to-medium-sized,{' '}
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnivorous">omnivorous mammals</a>{' '}
			belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. Foxes have a flattened
			skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a
			long bushy tail (or brush).
		</p>
		<h2>The dog, just lazy</h2>
		<p>
			<em>The domestic dog</em> (Canis lupus familiaris when considered a
			subspecies of the gray wolf or Canis familiaris when considered a distinct
			species) is a member of the genus Canis (canines), which forms part of the
			wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore.
			The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not
			closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies
			that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was the first
			species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia
			for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.

		<h3>More about dogs</h3>
		<p>
			Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to
			human behavior and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that
			would be inadequate for other canid species. New research seems to show
			that dogs have mutations to equivalent genetic regions in humans where
			changes are known to trigger high sociability and somewhat reduced
			intelligence. Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors. Dogs perform
			many roles for people, such as{' '}
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog">
				hunting, herding, pulling loads
			</a>, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more
			recently, aiding handicapped individuals and therapeutic roles. This
			influence on human society has given them the sobriquet “man's best
			friend”.
